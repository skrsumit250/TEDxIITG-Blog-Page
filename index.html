                </a>
                <p>Imagine you worked really hard to get into the university or job you wanted. You are full of joy and
                    great expectations. However, on the very first day, a pit forms in your stomach as you realize that
                    you don’t belong here. It seems like it wasn’t your drive or accomplishments that brought you here,
                    but luck and luck alone.</p>

                <p>A day had been taken out to shift the viewpoint from male-centric assumptions and focus to
                    experiences analyzed from a rather female lens. Acknowledging that gender is the first social
                    category that any individual experiences, it’s pervasiveness has been evident and inevitable.</p>

                <p>How many times do you hear this — “Be Original”? You hear the phrase “Be Creative!” somewhere or the
                    other on a frequent basis. But then we must dive deep and find an answer to what originality is and
                    how are we to express and evaluate creativity.
                    In a world where everyone is busy imitating others and also trying to fit in, how can one remain
                    original?</p>
